## Bugs

-   Initially, when clicking on the navbar links to the sections in the page the h2 header was covered by the navbar.
    ![Screenshot Navigation to section Bug ](./documentation/navclick-to-section.png)
-   By adding padding to the top of the section class the navbar was not covering the h2 header.

-   On smaller screens, the navbar did not close when clicking on links to sections on the same page.
    ![Screenshot Navigation to section Bug ](./documentation/navbar-not-closing.png)
-   Fixed by adding javaScript to ensure the navbar closes when clicking internal links

```
    <script>
        document
            .querySelectorAll(".navbar-collapse .nav-link")
            .forEach((link) => {
                link.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
                    let section = document.querySelector(e.target.getAttribute("href"));
                    if (section) {
                        e.preventDefault(); // Prevent default anchor click behavior
                        let navbarHeight = document.querySelector(".navbar-toggler").offsetHeight;
                        window.scroll({
                            top: section.offsetTop - navbarHeight, // Adjust for navbar height
                            behavior: "smooth",
                        });
                        document
                            .querySelector(".navbar-collapse")
                            .classList.remove("show"); // Collapse navbar
                    }
                });
            });
    </script>
```

-   Relative measures were also applied to image sizes, divs, and sections across all pages, as suggested and explained by the tutor to enhance responsiveness.
